# Tempest JTAG-PDI RE project

## What is Tempest

Tempest is the Atmel JTAG-PDI protocol documentation and RE project.

## What does this contain

This project contains documentation on the JTAG-PDI protocol used by many of the ATXMega series and similar processors.
It documents both the program, and debug components with the intention of providing a clean source of documentation for 3rd party implementations of PDI.

The goal is to allow for a full Open-Source implementation of program and debug tooling for these chips thereby eliminating the need/reliance on Windows-only vendor tools for FOSS projects.
